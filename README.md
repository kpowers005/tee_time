# TeeTime, the place to go for your next golf outing!

This site was designed with golfers in mind. As a solo golfer I often find myself in a position where I am forced to golf with people I don't know. The goal was to alleviate some of the anxiety and/or frustration that might go along with that. With TeeTime you can see who is going to be golfing when, so that it might be possible to reach out to someone who has a similar skill level to yourself and golf.


### Site hosted by heroku [here](https://tee-time-app.herokuapp.com/)
